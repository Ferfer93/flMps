#Self propelled particle simulations

> Simple one core simulation of self propelled particles with alignment interactions.

## Parameters
1. System size
2. Cell size
3. Number of particles
4. Timestep size
5. Rotational diffusion
6. Space diffusion
7. Particle radius
8. Alignment coupling
9. Number of timesteps
10. How often to write snapshots
11. How many particles' positions to write to output

# Notes
2. Is the cell size in which to look for collisions and interactions
5. Is the strength of the noise on the particle direction
6. Strength of the noise on the position
11. Can be useful if there are a lot of particles
